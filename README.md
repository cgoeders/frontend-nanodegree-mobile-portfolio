#Project 4: Website Performance Optimization



##Instructions

My project is hosted via gh-pages at the following URL. Please open in Chrome. 
http://cgoeders.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/

Commented source code for this project can be found on the master branch (under "src/"). Distribution code has been optimized (minified, stripped of most comments, compressed) and is found on the gh-pages branch. 

Note: A list of resources used for this project (Resources.txt) is included on the master branch. 



##Optimizations Performed

###Part I: Achieving PageSpeed â‰¥ 90 on index.html
- reduced file sizes by minifying HTML, CSS, and JS with grunt plug-ins (and manual insertion of minified CSS and JS into minified HTML)

- compressed images using Adobe Photoshop and compressnow.com; created thumbnail-sized version of pizzeria.jpg

- avoided render-blocking from CSS by inlining content of style.css

- added "print" media query to prevent print.css from being render-blocking

- added async attribute to Google Analytics and js/perfmatters scripts

- added Web Font Loader to asynchronously load Google font

###Part II: Achieving 60fps scrolling and <5ms pizza resizing on pizza.html
- moved constant variables and/or some variable declarations outside loops (e.g. in changePizzaSizes(), updatePositions()) to avoid forced synchronous layout events

- removed determineDx function (simplified calculation of new pizza widths)

- replaced querySelectorAll() with getElementsByClassName() or getElementById()

- added "will-change: transform" property to views/style.css to allow creation of new layers for "mover" pizzas

- limited number of sliding pizzas created on page load (used 40 instead of 200)

- minified HTML, CSS, and JS; compressed images

[ORIGINAL PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS]

## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
